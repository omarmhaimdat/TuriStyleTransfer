## Image Style Used

I have used two styles:

* **Style number 1:** it's a Moroccan Zellige which is a technique typical of Maghreb architecture that consists of assembling pieces of enamelled terracotta tiles of different colors to achieve a geometric decoration. The shards of faience are sometimes so fine that it is a true ceramic marquetry.
* **Style number 2:** That's an art piece made by a young Moroccan artist, you can check out his Instagram page
* **Input image:** well, that's me
